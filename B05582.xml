            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Forasmuch as the Importation of Brandy, and other Forraign Waters; and of Mum-beer, and other Liquors made of Mault; being by long and constant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence found destructive to the Product and Manufactory of this Our Ancient Kingdom, and prejudicial to Our Customs. And whereas by the twenty sixth Act of the third Session of Our first <hi>Parliament,</hi> Our Royal Prerogative in the disposal and ordering of Trade with Forraign Nations, in the laying on of Restraints and Impositions upon Forraign imported Commodities, is asserted to belong to Us, and Our Successors, as an undoubted Prerogative of Our Crown. And therefore, and for the good and profite of Our said Kingdom, We with advice of Our Privy Council, Do discharge the importing, venting, and selling of Brandy, and all other Forraign Strong-waters; as also of all Mum-beer, and all Forraign Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors made of Mault (Spruce-beer, called Black-beer, only excepted,) after the first day of <hi>November</hi> next, which time and no longer, is allowed for consuming of what is already Imported, or Exporting the same: And after that day, We hereby Command and Impower all Sheriffs, Stewarts, Bailiffs of Regalities, and Bailiaries, and their Deputes, Magistrates of Burghs Royal, Barons of Baronries, Commissioners of Excise, Justices of Peace, and all others in any publick Imployment whatsoever, to stave and destroy the said Brandy, Mum-beer, and other Forraign Liquors foresaids, and Casks thereof, where ever the same can be found; and the saids Magistrates, and all others foresaids, are hereby Impowered to execute this Our Commission within one and others Territories and Jurisdictions, as fully as within their own; And We do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Ordain the Ships or Vessels wherein the said Brandy or Liquors foresaids shall happen to be Imported, to be confiscate and seised upon, by any of the saids Magistrates, or others foresaids; the Skippers to be imprisoned, the Retailers fined in fourty pound <hi>Scots; toties quoties;</hi> the Customers who do either connive at, or cover any way the said unwarrantable Import, to lose the benefit of their Tack being Tacksmen, and otherways fined as the Lords of Our Privy Council shall find cause; and if they be under Officers of the Custom-house, to be imprisoned and fined at the Judges pleasure, and declared incapable of any such trust thereafter; and if Our Customs be not in Tack, the chief Collector, or Collectors, to be punished by deprivation, and a Years imprisonment; and all Merchands and others, Importers of the said Brandy and other prohibited Liquors, are to be fined in the quadruple of the value thereof: And further, they, and any Burgess who shall vent and sell the same, shall lose and amit their Burgeships for ever. And further, We do hereby discharge the making of Brandy, or Strong-waters within this Kingdom hereafter, of any thing, except of Mault, under the pain of staving and destroying thereof, and the Makers thereof otherwise, or Venters of the same, are to suffer a Years imprisonment, beside the staving and destroying of the same by the Persons, and in manner foresaid. And to the effect this Our Prohibition may be the more effectual, We do hereby Declare, that all Persons, of what quality soever, who shall be found to be drinkers of Brandy, or of the other prohibited Liquors fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saids, after the said first day of <hi>November</hi> next, shall be fined in fourty pound <hi>Scots, toties quoties;</hi> the probation thereof, shall either be by Witnesses, or oath of Party. And it is hereby declared, that whosoever shall discover any of the Delinquencies of any of the Persons abovementioned, shall have the half of the Fines that shall happen to be imposed upon them, or any of them, for the said Delinquencies, and the other half of the Fines shall belong to the Magistrates who shall judge and prosecute the same. OUR Will is herefore, and We charge you strictly, and Command, that incontinent, these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the Mercat-cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Pear and Shore of <hi>Leith,</hi> and other places needful, and there by open Proclamation, make publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Premises; Ordaining hereby the Tacksmen of Our Customes to send and affix Copies thereof at all their publick Offices of this Kingdom; And that these Presents be printed, that none pretend ignorance.</p>
